# Cryptocurrency-price-prediction-and-analysis-system
The aim of the Project is to develop a user-friendly mobile application that utilizes machine learning models and real-time data to predict and analyze cryptocurrency prices. 
Features involved in this project are:
1. Implement machine learning models like Linear Regression and SVM to predict future cryptocurrency prices based on historical data.
2. Create interactive line charts to map historical price movements (e.g., past 1 day - 1 year) for each cryptocurrency.
3. Implement a customizable alert system that sends email notifications when a chosen cryptocurrency reaches a specific price point.

This price prediction and analysis system aims to provide users with a comprehensive suite of tools for cryptocurrency price prediction and analysis, enabling them to make informed investment strategies in a dynamic marketplace.
